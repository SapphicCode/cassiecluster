The files within this repository declare the current state of my cluster.

They define databases, web servers, web apps, and any number of other things. Issues are welcome, but pull requests will be treated with extreme scrutiny, considering the scope of the project.

Not every configuration file is currently in use, some remain as references for myself or others. I'd recommend a look at the CI files, especially the [pipeline](ci/concourse/pipeline.yml), to get an idea of what's currently being done.
